Rooted in Lincoln, inspired by Maine.
Lincoln’s known as the Land of 13 Lakes — surrounded by forest, farmland, and less than 100 miles from the ocean. It’s a place shaped by its past in paper and wood, and its present as a hub for local communities, makers, and seasonal visitors. 49Maine respects all of that.
We serve quality meats, fresh seafood, handmade pastas, and wood-fired pizzas — all crafted to let the ingredients shine. As local as we can be, as fresh as it gets, and always with care. From cocktails to desserts, our focus is on doing things right, not overdoing them.
It’s food that honors where we are and what we have — no shortcuts, no gimmicks. Just good Maine cooking with a little fire under it.
The Menu Is Live at 49Maine
Our kitchen is officially open, and so is the new menu.
Steaks, seafood, fresh pastas, craft drinks, and wood-fired pizzas — built around quality ingredients and treated with respect. From a 12oz Wagyu strip to a fire-finished half chicken and a rotating veggie pie that’s either genius or chaos (depending on what the chef found that day), there’s something for every appetite.
We’re proud to serve the people of Lincoln and beyond with a menu that reflects who we are and where we are — rooted in Maine, cooked with care, and served without pretense.
Come take a seat. The good stuff's hot.
